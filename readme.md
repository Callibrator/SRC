#Simple Robot Controller

##Getting Started.

	Just execute the PyAPI/SRCServer.py or compiled/dist/SRCServer.exe (if you are using windows) and visit 127.0.0.1 in order to view the web application.
	
	You will have to put your service ip and port in the boxes at the top left corner. After that click connect and you will have connected to the server.
	
	You can paste your configuration data in the text area after the button connect and then click load configuration file. This will replace the default configuration file
	with your own and it will run according to your key-message paris.
	
	
##Description

	SRC is a simple api/service/server that allow multiple clients to send serial signals to one device.

##Configuration
	###You can configure everything in the server by changing the server.config file
	
	service_port: The port of the tcp server, The clients use this port to connect to your server and send signals.
	web_port: The port of your web server. The web server is optional and you can ignore using it. You can use another web server like apache.
	It is NOT required for the html-webserver files to be in the same machine or in the same network, they can be somewhere totally diferent.
	
	service_ip: The ip of your server, it can be 127.0.0.1 if you want to run the program at localhost

	enable_web_server: Set to false if you do not want to run the http server. 
	
	robot_port: This is the port of your serial device (e.g arduino) It works on windows 7/8/10 (eg comX) or debian,ubuntu linux (eg, /dev/ttyXXX)
	
	bandwidth: Your serial communication bandwith (usually 9600)

	###The Client Configuration.
	
	The web page allows use to set a JSON object and describe what key sends what signal. For Example
	{
		"keys": {
			"w": "forward",
			"s": "backward",
			"d": "left",
			"a": "right"
		},
		"mouse": {
			"up": "forward",
			"down": "backward",
			"left": "left",
			"right": "right"
		}


	}
	
	in keys struct you can describe the keyboard key and what message sends each key. Taking into consideration the above example, if you press the w key you will send
	forward to your robot. Your robot will reiceve that message and execute whatever command you have told him to execute when he takes that message.
	
	in mouse you can set what mouse will send. It can only take 4 key-pairs (up,down,left,right) similar to keys struct. More specifically if you move your mouse up
	you will send forward...
	
	
	###The Arduino.
		The arduino can use serial to send data to the serial display on your browser. It support HTML tags (for the colors :D). Important Keep in mind that it uses
		the new character as a seperator in order to understand when to send the message.
		for example:
		`
			Serial.print("<div>")
			Serial.print(a_variable)
			Serial.println("</div>")
			
		`
		will send to the servcer <div> YOUR VALUE OF THE VARIABLE </div>
